# Procedurally Generated Map

Simple procedurally generated map made in Processing3 while studying some procedural content generation. 
Free to use, just put due credits somewhere and we're good.

## How to run
Just download all the files and run them with Processing (version used to create the project was **3.2.3**, but it should work in other versions).

## Commands

- Up/Down/Left/Right (Or WSAD): Moves the red ball around. **(Note: No wall collision encoded, so the ball passes through walls)**
- 'g' key: Generates new map using the hard-coded configuration.

## Changing room creation options

To change the values used for the map creation(minimum/maximum room size, tile size, maximum room number, etc), 
just modify that data in the beginning of PCGMain.pde.
